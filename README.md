## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data without being explicitly programmed. This repository is designed to make learning easy and engaging for beginners.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for running code interactively): [Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install)

Basic understanding of programming concepts is helpful, but no prior machine learning knowledge is needed!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishwas-Chaudhary/Machine-Learining.git
   cd Machine-Learining
